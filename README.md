# travel-plan
Write a program that creates a travel plan where you visit every continent from a given origin city and back using the shortest distance traveled. 

There are 6 continents to be visited (excluding Antarctica) so you should create a plan where you visit 6 cities (including the origin) in any order. The trip should start and end at the origin city which will be the input of the program.

**Input**

Any origin city ID

eg: BOM

(Bombay)

**Output**

List of cities in the order to be visited and the distance traveled.

Example:

BOM (Bombay, Asia) → PAR (Paris, Europe) → CAI (Cairo, Africa)→ NYC (New York, North America) → BOG (Bogota, South America) →SYD (Sydney, Oceania) → BOM (Back to Bombay)

Distance travelled: XYZ KMS
